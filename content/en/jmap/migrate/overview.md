### Migrating to Stalwart JMAP

The Stalwart Command Line Interface (CLI) allows administrators to quickly import user accounts and mailboxes
into Stalwart JMAP. For more information on how to authenticate using the CLI tool, please refer to the [manage overview](/jmap/manage) section.

The following subsections cover account and mailbox migration:

- [Bulk create accounts](/jmap/migrate/accounts/).
- [Import Maildir and mbox mailboxes](/jmap/migrate/mailboxes/).
